# AI-Powered-Fever-Detection-in-Livestock-using-Thermal-Imaging
This project is a  prototype demo  that uses thermal images of cows to detect signs of fever using deep learning. It combines computer vision and explainable AI techniques (Grad-CAM) to support early disease detection in livestock â€” a critical step for smarter, healthier, and more efficient farming.
